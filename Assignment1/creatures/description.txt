Creatures Competition.
THIS PROJECT IS ABOUT THREE CREATURES COMPETTING IN 
THREE DIFFERENT WEATHER CONDITION(SUNNY(),RAINY(),CLOUDY()).
INORDER TO EXECUTE THE PROJECT WE USE THE METHOD OF POLIMORPHISM.
SINCE ALL THE COMPETITORS ARE CREATURES 
WE CREATURE AN ABSRACT CREATURES CLASS 
WHERE ALL THE THREE CREATURES WILL INHERITE THE METHOD BY EXTENSION.
IN THE SUB CLASSES THIS METHOD INHERITED WILL BE 
OVERRIDED IN THE SUBCLASSES.
HOWEVER THE COMPETITION WILL BE READ FROM A FILE
SINCE AN ABSTRACT CLASS CAN’T BE INSTANTIATED 
WE CREATE A CLASS WHERE THE CREATURE CLASS WILL BE 
PASS AS IN AN ARRAYLIST. AND INIATAIZE IT IN THE CONSTRACTOR.
THEN WE CAN USE THE READ() METHOD TO READ THE FILE
AND ALSO THE REPORT() METHOD TO READ THE RESULT.
ALSO THE GETMAXVALUE() METHOD TO HAVE THE WINNER OF THE COMPETITION.
FINALLY WE CAN CALL THIS CLASS BY INIATIZING IT IN THE MAIN CLASS.
